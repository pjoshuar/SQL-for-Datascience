Data Scientist Role Play: 
Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. 

In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. 
For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. 
You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. 
You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. 
As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding 
where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor 
(Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, 
just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records 
for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table =  10000

viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	
SQL code used to arrive at the above answers:
SELECT count(*)
FROM attribute; 
-- Similarly replace the table name in the from clause with the
-- corresponding table names to get all the other relevant results.

2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key 
or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, 
please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
SQL code used to arrive at the above answers:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id)
FROM business;

ii. Hours = 1562
SQL code used to arrive at the above answers:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id)
FROM hours;

iii. Category = 2643
SQL code used to arrive at the above answers:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id)
FROM category;

iv. Attribute = 1115
SQL code used to arrive at the above answers:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT business_id)
FROM attribute;

v. Review = 10000
SQL code used to arrive at the above answers:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM friend;

xi. Elite_years = 2780
SQL code used to arrive at the above answers:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
FROM elite_years;

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? 
Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	SELECT count(*)
	FROM user 
	WHERE name is null;
	-- Similarly we can replace the 'name' with the respective column name to 
	-- find out if there are any null values in the user table.
	
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), 
largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.708
	select min(stars), max(stars), avg(stars)
    from review;   
			
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars
	
		min: 1		max: 5		avg: 3.654
	select min(stars), max(stars), avg(stars)
    from business;
	
	iii. Table: Tip, Column: Likes
	
		min: 0		max: 2		avg: 0.014
	select min(likes), max(likes), avg(likes)
    from tip;
	
	iv. Table: Checkin, Column: Count
	
		min: 1		max: 53		avg: 1.941

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. 
Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

Yes, the distribution of hours for both groups are different. Especially the 4,5 rated categories open in the evenings. On the other hand, the 2,3 rated categories
open in the mornings.


ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, we can see there is a difference in the reviews for the groups mentioned above.
         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

We can see from the results table that the categories related to health and body care are having a lot of reviews. This gives us an understanding that more people are interested 
in taking care of their fitness and health.

The other places like food and entertainment look like they are just nominal. Further analysis can be done by considering the sentiment of the reviews to get a deeper understanding.

SQL code used for analysis:

select b.city,c.category,b.stars,h.hours
from business b join category c
on b.id = c.business_id join hours h
on b.id = h.business_id
where city = 'Toronto'
group by b.stars
order by b.stars desc;

+---------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+-----+
| city    | category              | stars | hours                |  ct |
+---------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+-----+
| Toronto | Active Life           |   5.0 | Monday|17:00-22:00   |  15 |
| Toronto | Beauty & Spas         |   4.5 | Monday|11:30-18:00   | 187 |
| Toronto | Restaurants           |   4.0 | Saturday|18:00-23:00 |  57 |
| Toronto | Venues & Event Spaces |   3.5 | Saturday|18:00-2:00  |  36 |
| Toronto | Yoga                  |   3.0 | Saturday|8:00-20:00  |  63 |
| Toronto | Bars                  |   2.5 | Saturday|10:00-2:00  |  35 |
| Toronto | Restaurants           |   2.0 | Saturday|11:00-23:00 |  21 |
+---------+-----------------------+-------+----------------------+-----+


		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
We can see that there are 15% of the businesses that were not active(closed) and 85% of the business are still active and running.

         
         
ii. Difference 2:
 The number of reviews for the businesses that are open are far more than the number of reviews for the closed businesses.        
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select is_open, count(name),avg(stars)
from business
group by is_open;

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, 
predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. 
These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I would like to understand the customer reviews on the restaurants on a whole and try to analyze the satisfaction levels based on their experience on other words the customer sentiment.
This will help the businesses know and understand the issues that they might want to focus and improve on so that it will not only improve customer loyalty but also in increased sales.
         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
For this, I will be needing the information on all restaurants, the names of the businesses and the associated reviews/comments from the customers. This helps me to 
classify the reviews in to 2 different buckets like positive and negative sentiment and the associcated words which are having the highest frequency which gives a clear understanding 
of whats wrong and what went well.
                           
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
+-------------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| category    | name                                   | text                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Restaurants | Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse | My husband and I decided to come here for a Saturday date night. When considering our options, we were sold when we saw the bacon board on the menu. It did not disappoint! It was an excellent and delicious start to our nice (giant) dinner.                                                                                                                                                        |

|             |                                        | For our main course we had the BBQ sampler for two, as well as the shrimp and grits appetizer because I just couldn't help myself! The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon. Marvelous.                                         |
|             |                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|             |                                        | The sampler was very good, but not amazing. I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile. |

|             |                                        | Since we brought up the missing turkey,  we were given a cobbler desert for free. That's about as much as I would pay for that dessert - $0 - as it tasted like hot, vaguely-fruity mush with a layer of raw flour on top. Whatever... they don't claim to be dessert experts, so what did I expect? I just know better for next time. ;)                                                              |

Just hipster enough to feel cool, but not so much to make you feel uncomfortable if you didn't show up with facial hair or a vintage t-shirt. Service is not as attentive as I would prefer, but most likely due to having too much to do, as opposed to a lack of effort. Everyone was very nice.                                                       |

| Restaurants | Bootleggers Modern American Smokehouse | This restaurant has the absolute best atmosphere. It starts from the moment you get out of your car and smell the aroma from the smokehouse.

|             |                                        | Beef Ramen - for 5 you can get a bowl of ramen (same noodles as used at Monta) and it comes with big chunks of beef. They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side. It was good, and it's exactly what you expect to get, ramen and beef. Great flavor and the broth was well seasoned. |
